I have a passion for Visual Art and Design, Music and sounds, Game and Learning.
And a few other stuff.

I love solving problems, and programming is perhaps my main tool to do that.

Therefore, I'm on a quest to link my passions with my willing to create cool
stuff through coding.

I also like to travel, so if I can do the above while being able to jump from places
to places all over the world, it'd dope.

I have a lot to learn, and I don't know where to start. Maybe with this site,
referencing my work so far I'm not too ashamed of.

Take time to explore what's on this site, make yourself at home and reach me
out if you'd like to!
